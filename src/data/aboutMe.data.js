const aboutMe = `Growing up, I always had a passion for technology and had a great attention to detail. My family taught me that hard work and determination pays off, and I have kept that to heart ever since. I was a volunteer firefighter which taught me teamwork, communication, and improved my problem solving.
\n
From there I became a maintenance engineer, where I learned independence, version control, and how to network. Along my journeys, I received promotions, and pay raises, but it never satisfied my passion.
\n
When COVID hit, my place of business shut down, and instead of sitting around or panicking, I immediately went back to school, and learned full stack web development. I followed my passion. Because I love what I do so much, I learn it so much faster. Coding, web development, designing, all speak to me. They fulfill my desire to problem solve and to be creative. However, doing a career switch is difficult for anyone, so I am relying on my networking, my determination, and trusting my newfound skills.
\n
I graduated from the University of Oregon's full stack web development program, and began looking for work. I received accolades from my teaching staff, classmates, and recruiters. I graduated with straight A's, the beginning of a new network, and knowing the MERN stack. Other than learning MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, I also learned MySQL, Git, jQuery, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Google APIs, NASA APIs, version control, and how to work in an Agile environment.
\n
I then never stopped learning and immediately began courses through Udemy to gain even more knowledge. I wanted to improve my skills in React, so I began a course teaching Redux, GraphQL, Stripe, and Firebase. Along the way I learned Typescript, SCSS, Shopify, and more!
\n 
I am currently doing freelance work and am part of a startup. If you would like to contact me about freelance jobs, see the contact me section!
